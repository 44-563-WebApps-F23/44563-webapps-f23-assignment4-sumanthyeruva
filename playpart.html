        <p><h4>MRS LINDE.</h4>
            <p>_[looking at her watch]_.</p> Not yet—and the time is nearly up. If only he
        does not—. <p>_[Listens again.]_</p> Ah, there he is.<p> _[Goes into the hall and
        opens the outer door carefully. Light footsteps are heard on the
        stairs. She whispers.]_</p> Come in. There is no one here.</p>

        <p><h4>KROGSTAD.</h4>
            <p>_[in the doorway]_.</p> I found a note from you at home. What does this
        mean?</p>

        <p><h4>MRS LINDE.</h4>
        It is absolutely necessary that I should have a talk with you.</p>

        <p><h4>KROGSTAD.</h4>
        Really? And is it absolutely necessary that it should be here?</p>

        <p><h4>MRS LINDE.</h4>
        It is impossible where I live; there is no private entrance to my
        rooms. Come in; we are quite alone. The maid is asleep, and the Helmers
        are at the dance upstairs.</p>

        <p><h4>KROGSTAD.</h4>
        <p>_[coming into the room]_.</p> Are the Helmers really at a dance tonight?</p>

        <p><h4>MRS LINDE.</h4>
        Yes, why not?</p>

        <p><h4>KROGSTAD.</h4>
        Certainly—why not?</p>

        <p><h4>MRS LINDE.</h4>
        Now, Nils, let us have a talk.</p>
