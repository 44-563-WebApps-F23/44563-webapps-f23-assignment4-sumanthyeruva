        _[looking at her watch]_. Not yet—and the time is nearly up. If only he
        does not—. _[Listens again.]_ Ah, there he is. _[Goes into the hall and
        opens the outer door carefully. Light footsteps are heard on the
        stairs. She whispers.]_ Come in. There is no one here.<br>

        <b>KROGSTAD.</b><br>
        _[in the doorway]_. I found a note from you at home. What does this
        mean?<br>

        <b>MRS LINDE.</b><br>
        It is absolutely necessary that I should have a talk with you.<br>

        <b>KROGSTAD.</b><br>
        Really? And is it absolutely necessary that it should be here?<br>

        <b>MRS LINDE.</b><br>
        It is impossible where I live; there is no private entrance to my
        rooms. Come in; we are quite alone. The maid is asleep, and the Helmers
        are at the dance upstairs.<br>

        <b>KROGSTAD.</b><br>
        _[coming into the room]_. Are the Helmers really at a dance tonight?<br>

        <b>MRS LINDE.</b><br>
        Yes, why not?<br>

        <b>KROGSTAD.</b><br>
        Certainly—why not?<br>

        <b>MRS LINDE.</b><br>
        Now, Nils, let us have a talk.
